## What does this repo contains?

Here you will find a small library of components managed with [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/get-started/introduction) and [Emotion css](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) and a single page application to manage a list of games and the details of each game.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```

## Storybook

To run Storybook simply execute this command on the terminal:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

## Web

To start the web page run this command on the terminal

## Extras

I had some time during the test and i tried to add some features that would be great in a real project

- Storybook: Allows you to see all the components and pages of your web.
- Multi theme suport: The web is build with multi theme, you can easly create new theme and add them to the project with no repercusion.

## Things that I would have liked to add

- Unit testing
- Multi language suport with i18n
- Redux
